## Basic System Functionality

I need basic functionality for this system because I do intend to use this in the real world. For example:
- be able to do all the programming stuff:
  - vscode
  - gcc c/c++ compiling
  - running docker, rust, & npm projects
  - web browser
- be able to do simple computer things:
  - web browser (zen)
  - normal, easy, fast file management
  - view files
  - edit documents?
  - compress/extract .zips
